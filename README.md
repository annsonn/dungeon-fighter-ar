Dungeon Fighter AR!
=========================

This was a hackathon project to try to build something with WebARonARKit and WebARonARCore.

To demo this app you will need install an experimental browser on your mobile device.
`WebARonARKit` - https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARKit
`WebARonARCore` - https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore

The application is built ontop of an experimental version of `three.ar.js` - https://github.com/google-ar/three.ar.js
As well as experimental version of the popular VR framework `AFrame` - https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe-ar

To demo the project, import it into `Glitch` - http://glitch.com and go to the live page on your mobile device.

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

**Glitch** is the friendly commmunity where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
